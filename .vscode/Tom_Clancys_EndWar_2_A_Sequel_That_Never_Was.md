Tom Clancy's EndWar was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and was intended to be the first installment of a new franchise. The game received mixed reviews from critics and gamers, who praised its innovative voice control system but criticized its repetitive gameplay, lack of depth and technical issues. The game sold moderately well, but not enough to justify a sequel. Ubisoft announced in 2010 that they were working on Tom Clancy's EndWar 2, but the project was later cancelled due to budget cuts and poor sales of the first game.
 
Tom Clancy's EndWar 2 was supposed to be a more ambitious and improved version of the original game, with more factions, units, maps, modes and features. The game was also planned to have a deeper story and more branching choices that would affect the outcome of the war. The game was also supposed to have a more realistic and dynamic weather system that would affect the gameplay and the visuals. The game was also supposed to have a more advanced voice command system that would allow players to use natural language and complex commands.
 
However, Tom Clancy's EndWar 2 never saw the light of day, and remains one of the many cancelled games in the Tom Clancy franchise. Fans of the original game have been hoping for a sequel for years, but Ubisoft has not shown any interest in reviving the series. The only way to play Tom Clancy's EndWar 2 is to download a torrent of the leaked alpha version that was released online in 2016. However, this version is incomplete, buggy and unstable, and does not represent the final vision of the developers.
 
Tom Clancy's EndWar 2 is a game that could have been great, but was doomed by poor sales, budget cuts and changing market trends. It is a game that many fans still want to play, but will probably never get to experience. It is a game that remains as one of the lost gems of the Tom Clancy franchise.

One of the few glimpses of Tom Clancy's EndWar 2 was the alpha version of EndWar Online, a browser-based spin-off that was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and Ubisoft Chengdu. EndWar Online was a free-to-play online strategy game that was set after the events of the first game, where players had to rebuild their factions and fight for resources and territory. The game featured a single-player campaign mode and a multiplayer mode where players could battle each other or join forces in co-op missions.
 
EndWar Online was announced in 2013 and entered closed alpha testing in 2014. The game received positive feedback from the testers, who praised its graphics, gameplay and voice command system. The game was supposed to enter open beta testing in 2015, but it was delayed indefinitely due to technical issues and server problems. The game was eventually cancelled in 2016, along with Tom Clancy's EndWar 2. Ubisoft stated that they were unable to deliver the quality and experience that they had envisioned for the game.
 
EndWar Online was the closest thing to Tom Clancy's EndWar 2 that fans ever got to play, but it was also a far cry from the original vision of the sequel. The game was a simplified and casualized version of the first game, with less depth, variety and realism. The game also suffered from many of the problems that plague free-to-play games, such as pay-to-win mechanics, microtransactions and limited content. The game also lacked the offline mode and the cross-platform compatibility that made the first game unique.
